I like HUE bulbs. I feel the API really adds value to the lights. This is an attempt to get a similar API in front of the cheaper bluetooth bulbs.

Totally unfinished for now. But it works, for now just with the Mipow bulb. And it throws up a test page on the context root (ie. localhost:1000) which can fire the REST commands.
